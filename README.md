# SharkClicker
Console test application for my Shark Clicker game.

Contains a MySQL script that must be run first to construct the game's
database. The Visual Studio console application contains stored
procedures that have been imported from the game database in order to
perform CRUD actions essential for operation of the game.

The console application simply tests all stored procedures and functions
to demonstrate how the game will run. Procedures are split into two
groups: player/game procedures and administrator procedures.
